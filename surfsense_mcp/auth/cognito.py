"""Cognito provider that surfaces id-token identity to the SurfSense relay.

Why this exists
---------------
FastMCP's stock ``AWSCognitoProvider`` validates the inbound Cognito **access
token** and filters its claims down to ``{sub, username, cognito:groups}``
(see ``fastmcp.server.auth.providers.aws.AWSCognitoTokenVerifier``). Two facts
about Cognito access tokens make that insufficient for identifying the upstream
SurfSense user:

* they carry **no ``email`` claim** at all, and
* for users federated from an external IdP (e.g. askii.ai), ``username`` is an
  opaque Cognito UUID (``09daf50c-…``), not the human identifier the web login
  keys on (``1020010000020127``).

The browser/cookie login resolves the right user because oauth2-proxy reads the
**id_token**, whose ``email`` claim (``1020010000020127@askii.ai``) SurfSense's
``ProxyAuthMiddleware`` prefers. To make the MCP path land on that *same* user,
we need the id_token's claims — but the access-token verifier never sees them.

``OAuthProxy`` exposes the right seam: :meth:`_extract_upstream_claims` is
called with the full Cognito token response (access_token + id_token + …) at
exchange *and* refresh time, and whatever it returns is sealed inside the
FastMCP-signed reference JWT and handed back at request time as
``AccessToken.claims["upstream_claims"]`` (consumed by
:mod:`surfsense_mcp.auth.http`). We decode the id_token there and stash
``email``, ``cognito:username``, and the raw id_token string.

Trust note
----------
The id_token is decoded **without signature verification**, which is safe here:

* it arrives directly from Cognito's token endpoint over the provider's own
  server-to-server TLS call — never from the MCP client, and
* the extracted values are re-sealed inside the FastMCP JWT whose signature
  *is* verified on every request before ``upstream_claims`` is read.

The inbound access token is still independently JWKS-verified on every request
by the stock verifier, so this adds no auth-bypass surface — it only enriches
the identity forwarded downstream.

# already expired, refresh stays gated while JWKS validation already fails -
# after which the refresh grant recovers the session.

    """Real remaining lifetime of the upstream access token, from its own ``exp``.

    ``mpass-auth-proxy`` reports ``SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`` (7 days) as
    ``expires_in`` because oauth2-proxy — the session authority for the browser
    flow — trusts that value for its cookie lifetime. The Cognito access token
    underneath still expires in one hour.

    On the MCP path the session authority is FastMCP's ``OAuthProxy``, which keys
    renewal off ``expires_in``: it stores ``expires_at = now + expires_in`` and
    stamps the token it issues to the MCP client with the same lifetime. With the
    7-day value the stored expiry is a week out, so at the one-hour mark JWKS
    validation of the real token fails while the refresh gate stays shut — the
    request 401s and the MCP client is forced through a full interactive
    re-authorization. Deriving the value from the token's own ``exp`` restores the
    invariant: the client's token now expires when the upstream one does, and it
    renews through the refresh grant (which ``mpass-auth-proxy`` relays to Cognito)
    rather than re-authorizing. Note this makes the client-facing token hourly too
    — decoupling the two needs ``fastmcp_access_token_expiry_seconds``, absent from
    the fastmcp 3.2.x line the sibling MCP servers pin, so it is not used here.

    Returns ``None`` when the lifetime can't be determined, leaving the upstream
    value untouched.
